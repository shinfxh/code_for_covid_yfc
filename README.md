Corona in a Box by yfc

Language: Python 

Packages needed: PyGame, PyGame_GUI

A deadly contagious virus just hit your city. As the mayor, responsibility now falls on you to save your people. But facing costly policies with tight budget, can you make the right decisions in time?

A python-based game where the player (the "government") tries to contain the spread of the virus given limited resources. The game is initiated with a single character infected. Uninfected characters staying within a certain radius from the infected character for a certain period of time has a certain probability of being infected. The player's actions include: mass testing characters for whether they carry the virus, quarantining players/groups, and wider societal lockdown. All player actions come at a cost. The player's aim is to keep the total infections/deaths below a certain number using a limited budget.
